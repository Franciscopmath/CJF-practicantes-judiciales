Method created to assign scholarship recipients

I created and implemented a method that uses statistical and data mining methods to assign a "weight" to each legal body.

The code "metodo_moda.R" that is in "resumen_ejecutivo/meta moda" moda calculates the mode of several time series and chooses the largest.

Using the SPSS Hierarchical Cluster Analysis algorithm, segment around 400 time series, some results are in "resumen_ejecutivo/metodo_cluster_jerarquico". By law I cannot share the data.
